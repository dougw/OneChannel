# OneChannel
OneChannel - one tap Slack iOS

OneChannel is the fastest way to get a message into Slack. It's a one page app that sends the message to one slack channel. That's all it does and it does it exxtremely well.

It was built as a hackweek project at the now defunt Copper, as one of the first apps every to work one the Slack API. 

I did not renew my developer license and the app fell out of the App Store in 2020. I am handing it over to the open source community to do it's thing.

This code hasn't been updated in years, so it's very possible dependencies are broken and it may need work to run at this point.
